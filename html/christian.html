            <h1>My philosophy</h1>
            <p>Sparta is a city in Laconia, on the Peloponnese in Greece. In antiquity, it was a powerful city-state
                with a famous martial tradition. Ancient writers sometimes referred to it as Lacedaemon and its people
                as Lacedaemonians.

                Sparta reached the height of its power in 404 B.C. after its victory against Athens in the second
                Peloponnesian war. When it was in its prime, Sparta had no city walls; its inhabitants, it seems,
                preferred to defend it with men rather than mortar. However, within a few decades, after a defeat
                against the Thebans at the Battle of Leuctra, the city found itself reduced to a "second-rate power," a
                status from which it never recovered.

                The prowess and fearlessness of Sparta's warriors has inspired the Western world for millennia and, even
                in the 21st century, has been incorporated into Hollywood films like "300" and the futuristic video game
                series "Halo" (where a group of super- soldiers are called "Spartans").</p>
